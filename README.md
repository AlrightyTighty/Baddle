Baddle is a competetive spin on the hit word game "Wordle". In this game, you're given 6 guesses to guess a 5 letter word. The catch? Your friends are all guessing the same word.

You earn points based on the quality of your guesses (how many green/yellow characters you get in your guess) as well as how many attempts it takes you to guess the word.

Start a room and give your friends the join code so they can join your room. Once you're ready, press start, and the game is yours to play!.
